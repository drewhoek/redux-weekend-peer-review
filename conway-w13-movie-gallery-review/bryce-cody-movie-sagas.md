### Notes:   
Nice job on this one Bryce. Functioality is top notch, and styling is looking good on the whole. 
Theres a couple things I would work on for stying. 
One big one would be limiting the size of the user submitted images so they match the existing ones coming from the imgs files.
Smaller things would be getting the Click Poster For Details header centered, and Getting some stying add movie button, as well as the button on the details page.

### Notes: 
I like the way you comment your code, descriptive, and only where it needs to be. Well done.
Fell a little short, on commits, but the commit messages where clear, and easy to read.
