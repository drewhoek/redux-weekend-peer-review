### Notes: Hey dude, nice effort. I know you said you're still working on it and you know what you have to get done so I wont go over any of that. I liked how you were using a table 
on movie details, and you did a nice job mapping using filter on movie details as well. This was a really hard assignment and you're on the right track. Just keep doiong what you're 
doing and I'm sure it will turn out great.
