### Notes:

Great work on the Back and Edit score abilty stretch goal! I did notice one thing, after you edit the score, it wipes out the other scores too. Not sure if that's intentional, but still allows to submit with no issues.

Don't forget to commit more often just for more return save points to move back to. Not very many comments in the code. I'm not sure of how many comments are needed to be "appropriate".
I would also use a formatter at the end of your submit for completion. Mary suggested "Prettier" and it helps clean up white space and alignments.
As far as the readme. I'm not sure if it was a requirement, and I'm guilty of it this week too, but some information about how you approach your assignments and what struggles you come across.

Overall I really like your coding. Your doing a great job overall!
