### Notes:

FrontEnd: The code is concise, clean and consistent. Very readable, with attention to spacing and naming of folers/files/functions/variables. Comments were made to clarify where needed, as why I mentioned the amount was appropriate. I'm sure there could be more, but this is subjective. One very minor observation, is to remove commented out code if not needed (ref: App.js line 15-19). If this is code that is required, then disregard.

BackEnd: I like the object destructure on the POST request. It's good to see more comments on the backend, such as in the router file. Gave me a good idea of what your were doing.

Overall, excellent job! Minimal code to get the job done.
