Notes on General Items

- Not trying to be nitpicky I apologize in advance if any feedback seems to be that way.

- For the submit button, it does send data to server but also dispatches CLEAR_FEEDBACK 
where the Leave New Feedback button should be the one dispatching but the Leave New Feedback 
button still brings you back to the start.

- Definitely could use more code comments, something that helps me is using comments to 
describe what I am doing with the code to better understand it.

- The README needs to be updated

- I like your button styling, a neat tip is in the css try putting cursor: pointer; for your buttons
and that will change the cursor style when interacting with the buttons.

- The inputs look awesome, way better than the basic input styling! Love the underlines!

- Input validation would be a beneficial feature, I noticed I do not have to type anything in on any part of the 
form to proceed to the next page. For your number inputs maybe try checking if the value is not "" or empty.

- I noticed a few functions that are not being used, ie. In Comments.js the handleComment function on line 13. 
I would go back and clear out code that is not being used to make things neater. Although I do see that function 
has an alert so it could be used in input data validation.

- You definitely have the concepts down just looks like there is a bit of patchwork to be done.
