Notes on General Items
Overall looks great! I like the nice clean look you kept through the pages. I really like the use of an alert component through the pages with numbers required. The file organization made sense and flowed nicely. I felt it easy to track the logic through the files.

Thing to work on:
The only real thing I can see that could be improved is just general notes? I liked all the inline notes but maybe a description "block" to describe the function as a whole in addtion to the inline notes? Not 100% on this as I get told to add more notes every week and this amount is what I feel like I would include normally.
