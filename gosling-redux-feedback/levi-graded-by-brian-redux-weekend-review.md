### Notes:

- The home page is really cool where you have an interesting background, but it wasn't clear whether it was a loading page 
or if you had to scroll to get the information of the page. 
- Over all looks really good, I like the background, that it blurs when scrolled down on the hompage. 
- On the details view I like it also has the movie name in the background blurred and off set in the, what would be, negative space.
- The back button on the details page is cool to have the slide swap colors between text and background of the button
- Really like the read me how it has a preview of what the app looks like

### Things To Work On:

-add more commits; having an intialization commit and then a final commit can be a little dangerous if things crash.
-add more description to commits so that you know what changed between them
