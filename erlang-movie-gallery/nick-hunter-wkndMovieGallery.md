Yo nick, 

You've met all the functional requirements!
To improve, I'd work on some stretch goals to allow more than one genre to be added to the movie and also add some styling before you make it public to employers.
I'm impressed by the grid layout where if you add a large picture, it fits it to a certain height and width. This has potential to inspire your solo project which I am exiced to see! 
All looks good though overall, its funcitonal and a cool project :)
