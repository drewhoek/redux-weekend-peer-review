-- Movies Page --

Movie list is nice and organized. Each movie is clearly labeled. Can easily click on a movie to go to the details page.

List even scales nicely for different browser sizes.

-- Details Page --

All genres are shown and the back to home button works. The page heiharchy makes sense for the most part. There is maybe some 
redundant / unnecessary information, such as 'movie title' and 'movie description'. Both of these can be inferred by the user.
There aree two forms at the bottom which seem like they are there for editing information on the movie. It is unclear how to
confirm the changes.

Although a little bare, this page has what it needs and also scales nicely for different browser sizes. 

-- Add Form -- 

I like this feature! When I added a movie it was displayed in the gallery which is cool! I was not able to click it and go to
the details page however. 

-- Styling --

Overall the layout is not bad! Gets the job done. I would try to use less harsh colors. Maybe in the future think more 
about the color pallette of the whole project.
