### Notes:

Hey Tre, I really liked going through your assignment. The color scheme looked great and tied in well with MUI. One thing I would point out, when leaving multiple responses your store isn't cleared out. I left one response, went back through without actually filling out the fields, and my responses from the first feedback loop still appeared. Great job!

Notes on the above Functional Requirements.
