### Notes:

Notes on the above Functional Requirements.

Good job, Andy. You almost got there and just have a few things to clean up 
and get in order. Here are some things I found, which you probably already know. 

1. Had to add: '/feedback' to getFeelings axios.get to run.

2. Getting a 404 on "next" click of feelings page. You have a POST in the 
feelings form, but no post in the router. I think there should only 
be one POST, on the final review page, to send all of the data at once. 
I think you were meaning to dispatch. 

3. Nav bar still functional, I see your notes about removing it though. 

4. Admin page is working well, nice work. 

5. The redux logger kind of breaks down after the first page, not sure why

6. Missing your dispatches from your forms in your handlesubmit functions

7. Missing your useSelector and axios.post from your review page. 

8. Need to display your redux state on your review page.
