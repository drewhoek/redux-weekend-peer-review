Hey Jamie,

General Feedback.     
Well done on the whole. The app is straight forward, and easy to use. One thing to consider getting rid of would be the save response button, and send a dispatch every time a radio button is clicked, rather than a seperate button.

Notes on General Items.    
 A small error that would be easy to get rid of is change all your class declarations to className.
