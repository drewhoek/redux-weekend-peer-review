Notes on General Items

Nice work. I really liked how the inline functions create clean and easy to understand code. Your formatting was done well and the project looked clean. You certainly know what you're doing and understand the material well. A couple quick notes, I didn't see any validation, except the alert which wasn't firing for me when I submitted empty values. I was also able to enter values below and equal to zero, as well as numbers higher than five. When I submitted empty values the review form still had the previous answers. Your console log on the comments page also logs every key stroke, which if fine, it just makes for a lot of scrolling when trying to go back and inspect things on the browser, which, I'm sure you know ha. You did a great job, everything was  
organized and well thought out. Keep up the great work.
