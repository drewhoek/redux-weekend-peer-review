### Notes:

David, as always, great job on the weekend challenge. The styling, functionality, the cleanliness of the code,
and what struck me as most impressive was the efficient and effective use of your code comments.
The hover over function on each indivudual movie, the details page and add movie component are all great. The only
areas I noticed were the edit and search features. I was not able to see the edits off the genres I had made, nor making any 
changes to the movie itself. Im sure with more time you will have these up and running no problem along with a detailed and informative readme.md. 

But overall, great job man!
