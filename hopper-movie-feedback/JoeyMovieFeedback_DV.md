### Notes:

I read the add form as a stretch goal so should be okay that it's not completed yet. I'd recommend to go back and try to add one since you already most of the way there.
It appears all base goals are complete and works as they are supposed to. This is a nice to base to continue building on.

### Notes:
Nice work on detail page working through refresh! Could use some 'good' practices. More code notes, more commits and an updated Readme would be good things to go back and add. Overall code layout is nice and organized. The logic of the program makes sense and is easy to follow. After doing a couple of those things pack it with some styling and you should be sitting pretty good. This is a nice base to work with, just needs some more love and attention.
