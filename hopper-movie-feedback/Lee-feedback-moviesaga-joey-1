### Notes:
Lee, you did a really fantastic job on this. All of the base stuff is there, and you added some really nice styling polish to the project. The site is functional and smooth!

12 commits, just a bit under the 15 required. 

I would also think about trying to incorporate more code comments. It will help ensure that you have a really clear idea of what each line is doing, and will also be useful if you ever go back to this project to add to it, or if you use it as a reference to build future projects.

You killed it Lee! Great work!
