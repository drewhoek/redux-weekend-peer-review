# Instructions for peer review

1. Add a file in this folder. Name it `parterName-yourName-projectName.md`. So if I am grading Blaine's redux weekend project, the filename could be `blaine-mary-redux-feedback-form.md`;
2. Make sure your filename ends in `.md` for markdown format
3. Paste in the ruberic, use the 'preview' functionality, save the file (on GitHub website is fine, or clone it down and push).
