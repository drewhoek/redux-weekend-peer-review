### Notes:

Notes on the above Functional Requirements:

Clearing the redux store upon submit was buried in the instructions file so i'd reccomend that you take a look at doing this. Otherwise, all looks good. I think you'll regret not having enough comments when you're looking back! Great job tho :)

Notes on General Items
all looks good and works but more comments, a readme, and clearing the redux store upon submit are all below expectations. I'd give you a 3 if you could submit these and have them in by 8am tomorrow morning.
